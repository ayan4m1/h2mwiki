**Q**: When is the mod planned to be released?

**A**: August 16th. A time has not yet been announced.

---

**Q**: What do I need in order to play the mod?

**A**: Get Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered (2017) on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/393080). You do not _need_ any DLC, but if a server you play on changes to a DLC map you will disconnect from that server.

---

**Q**: Are pirated copies of the game supported?

**A**: No, and please don't ask on the Discord.

---

**Q**: What are the system requirements?

**A**: The same as the base game.

---

**Q**: Will there be matchmaking?

**A**: No, there will be a server browser. It is expected that players will be able to host or rent their own server.

---

**Q**: Is the game limited to 90fps?

**A**: No, use the `/com_maxfps <value>` command ingame to change it to whatever you want.

---

**Q**: How do I fix the "Create2DTexture" or "Out Of Memory" error on startup?

**A**: You need to cancel the "shader cache population" at startup, then disable shader caching in the game's graphics settings.

---

**Q**: Will this mod work with the Steam Deck?

**A**: If your Steam Deck can run Modern Warfare Remastered multiplayer, then it should work.
